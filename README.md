## About This Project

This project was originally built using **React** as part of an exploration into microservices architecture and cloud-native deployment strategies. After initial deployment and performance testing, the project was optimized and simplified using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for static hosting.

If you're interested in viewing the original React-based implementation, you can find it [here](https://github.com/nolunchbreaks/greenish).
